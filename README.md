YoutubeClone
Description
YoutubeClone is a React Native application that mimics some functionalities of the YouTube app. It implements API integration with Redux Thunk for state management, infinite scroll for seamless browsing, animations for UI enhancements, and navigation to play videos and display additional information.

Features
API Integration with Redux Thunk: Implements API integration using Redux Thunk middleware for handling asynchronous actions and managing application state.

Infinite Scroll: Provides an infinite scroll feature for browsing through a large number of videos without pagination.

Animation on Show More Button: Utilizes animations to enhance the user experience when interacting with the "Show More" button.

Show More Button Functionality: Allows users to click the "Show More" button to display additional videos beyond the initial set.

Navigation Screen: Implements navigation to allow users to play videos, display additional information (e.g., name or creator), and provides a "Go Back" option for easy navigation.
